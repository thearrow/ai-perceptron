AI Homework #4 - Single Perceptron

COMPILE:
    (in klinglerHW4 folder):
    javac *.java

RUN:
    TRAIN:
        java Main train train.txt
        ...where train.txt is training data

    TEST:
        java Main test test.txt
        ...where test.txt is testing data


ABOUT:
    Program implements a single perceptron with N inputs and a
    logistic activation function. A bias term (input always = -1)
    is included in the perceptron. Input files should be in the
    format given in the assignment examples:

    3
    0.53,0.75,0.43,0
    0.8,0.74,0.46,1
    0.55,0.61,0.69,0
    ...etc...

    The first line is ignored, number of inputs/weights is determined
    lazily by the first line of data.
    After the neuron is trained it is saved to neuron.dat.
    The neuron is then loaded from this file for testing.

RESULTS:
    I tested the program using the sample training/test data
    given in the assignment.
    Output from the neuron is rounded to the nearest integer (0|1).
